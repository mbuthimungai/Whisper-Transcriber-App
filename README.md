# Whisper Transcriber App (Mobile)

A **React Native (Expo)** application that connects to a FastAPI backend running Whisper for **live transcription**, **audio**, and **video** file transcription.

---

## Features

- **Live Transcription** from mic
- Upload **audio files** for transcription
- Upload **video files** and extract speech
- All transcription is done **locally** via Whisper â€” no cloud API usage

---

## ðŸ”§ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Mobile App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbuthimungai/Whisper-Transcriber-App.git
cd Whisper-Transcriber-App/
npm install
```

### 2. Build the App with EAS (iOS only)

> For local iOS testing, you must use EAS to build with the `development` profile:

```bash
eas build --profile development --platform ios
```

This allows debugging on a local iOS simulator or physical device.

> Make sure your device/emulator is running and connected to the same network as the backend.

### 4. Clone the FastAPI Server

You can get the backend from:
[https://github.com/mbuthimungai/Whisper-Transcriber-API](https://github.com/mbuthimungai/Whisper-Transcriber-API)

Follow instructions in the API repo to start the server.

## Configuration

Update the backend URL in `app/constants/Constants.ts`:

```ts
export default {
  WS_BASE_URL: "ws://<your-ip>:8000",
  HTTP_BASE_URL: "http://<your-ip>:8000",
};
```
